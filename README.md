# Minerva Lambda Wars
Minerva Lambda Wars is a modded version of the original Lambda Wars which balances, removes and adds new features to the game. Allowing for longer matches and more fun matches. If you have any question regarding this mod, please feel free to contact me in Minerva Servers @ https://discord.gg/zDkjXrCDB2

# How to Install
Download the github repository and navigate to the Lambda Wars Directory (Steam/steamapps/common/Lambda Wars/lambdawars), create an addon folder if there isn't. Open the repository files and drag the VPK file into the addons folder, keep in mind Lambda Wars must not be started during this procedure.

# Multi-Player
If you want to play with friends, the lobby members *must* have the same VPK file as you have in the addons folder. Re-direct them to the github repository and wait until they installed the mod. Public Players will not be able to play with you in a match if you have this installed, if you want to play public matches with randoms you must un-install the VPK file (Deleting the VPK file).
